Summarize this conversation for the project manager, so work can resume later without rereading it. Do not modify anything.

Extra instructions (optional): <the text the user wrote with the skill invocation, if any>

Steps:
1. Review the conversation and the current repository state (`git status`, `git diff --stat`) to see what really changed on disk.
2. Output, short and schematic:
   - **Asked**: what the user wanted.
   - **Done**: what was completed, with the files touched and one plain line each. Never name a function, class or variable without saying what it does.
   - **Decisions**: choices made and why, separating what the user decided from what you decided yourself.
   - **Pending**: unfinished work, open questions and things not verified.
   - **State**: uncommitted changes, tests run and their result, anything that must not be forgotten (for example, not committed or not pushed).
3. Be faithful: if something failed or was not verified, say so.

Reply following the global communication rules.
