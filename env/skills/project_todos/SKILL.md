description: "List all TODO and FIXME comments grouped by area, with their reason and age. Read-only"

Collect the pending notes left in the code. Read-only: do not modify anything.

Focus (optional: a folder or a keyword): <the text the user wrote with the skill invocation, if any>

Steps:
1. Search tracked files for `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK` and `XXX` (`git grep -n`).
2. For each one, read the surrounding code to understand what it refers to, and use `git blame` to find when it was added.
3. Output, short and schematic:
   - **Count** by type and by area.
   - **Grouped by theme or module**: file and line, what is pending in plain words (never name a function or class without saying what it does), the reason if it has one, and its age.
   - **Without a reason**: notes that do not follow the `TODO(reason)` convention, listed separately.
   - **Old or probably stale**: notes whose work looks already done or no longer applicable. Do not remove them.
4. Highlight the few that look most important or risky, and why.
